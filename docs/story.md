1. Story 
"I built SentinelPay to solve fraud detection at Vietnamese scale. The system:

- Processes transactions in real-time using Kafka streams

- Applies Vietnamese-specific fraud rules (elderly scams, Tết fraud)

-   Combines rule-based logic with ML predictions

-   Deploys on Kubernetes for Tet holiday scaling

-   Provides explainable decisions for SBV compliance"
